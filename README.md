# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction üõçÔ∏èüìä

The goal of this project is to predict the sales of products in Big Mart stores based on historical data. By applying various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost, we aim to accurately forecast outlet production sales. This project serves as a great introduction to data analytics, machine learning, and feature engineering.

## Overview

The dataset contains historical sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. We will use the dataset to predict the sales for each product at a given store. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building predictive models.

Key tasks include:
- **Data Cleaning** üßπ
- **Feature Engineering** üîß
- **Model Evaluation** üìä
- **Sales Forecasting** üìà

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 8523 rows and 12 variables. The response variable to predict is `Item_Outlet_Sales`, which represents the sales of a product in a particular store. The predictor variables are various features like store location, item type, visibility, and more.

### Variables in the Dataset:
- **Item_Identifier**: Unique product ID
- **Item_Weight**: Weight of the product
- **Item_Fat_Content**: Whether the product is low-fat or not
- **Item_Visibility**: Percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to this product
- **Item_Type**: The category to which the product belongs
- **Item_MRP**: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
- **Outlet_Identifier**: Unique store ID
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: Year when the store was established
- **Outlet_Size**: Size of the store (in terms of ground area covered)
- **Outlet_Location_Type**: Type of city where the store is located
- **Outlet_Type**: Type of outlet (grocery store or supermarket)
- **Item_Outlet_Sales**: Sales of the product at the store (target variable)

## Project Workflow

This project will be structured in the following way:

### 1. Loading Packages and Data
We will load the necessary Python libraries and the BigMart dataset for analysis.

### 2. Data Structure and Content
We will examine the structure of the data, understand its types, and inspect the first few records.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We will perform exploratory data analysis to understand trends, outliers, and distributions in the dataset.

### 4. Missing Value Treatment
Handle missing or null values in the dataset using appropriate imputation techniques.

### 5. Feature Engineering
We will create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

### 6. Encoding Categorical Variables
We'll encode categorical features (like `Outlet_Type`, `Item_Fat_Content`, etc.) into numerical formats.

### 7. Preprocessing Data
Standardize or normalize numerical features and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 8. Model Building and Evaluation
We will train and evaluate multiple machine learning models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost**

### 9. Model Deployment
We will deploy the model using Flask for real-time predictions (Optional).
